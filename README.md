Hey, Iâ€™m Riddhi

Welcome to my GitHub!

Iâ€™m into AI, deep learning, and building cool stuff that (hopefully) works.

Currently studying Electronics & Telecommunication, but my heart's somewhere between Python scripts or chasing that perfect loss curve.

You'll find a mix of projects here , some smart, some experimental, all done with way too many tabs open.

Stick around if youâ€™re into tech, ideas, or just want to see what I break next ðŸ˜„
